Then, as nodes are expanded, the  maximum or minimum (depending on the type of node) values recorded from its visited child nodes are stored in alpha and beta respectively. If beta is less than alpha, that means the parent of the current node would never choose the path of the current node because no matter how much 'better' the value gets for the current node, its parent always wants the worst outcome for the current team, and will always choose one of its other children that we know has a worse outcome for the current team. This means that we can ignore/prune the rest of the current branch, and save time."
